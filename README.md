##Installation

There is no installation required for this project.


##Usage

The purpose of this was to demonstrate my understanding of local storage, usage of APIs, as well as other JavaScript functions and methods, all while making a functional, usable webpage.


##Functionality
This website functions by allowing the user to enter their tasks into input fields, then pressing a "save" button, which then stores that information in the page's local storage. It remains there until the user manually clears the fields. Using moment.js API, each input field also changes colors based on the time of day (specific colors depending on if the time is in the past, present, or future). The same API also allows the current date to be displayed at the top of the page.
